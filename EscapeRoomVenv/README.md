Welcome to the Escape Room

Install python 3.7.3 (tested) from
"https://www.python.org/downloads/"

(without quotation marks, also for the following commands)

Download the one relevant for your laptop. You can probably just click "Download Python 3.7.3" and it will download. For Windows laptops it will most probably be the 64 bit executable. During installation make sure that you've got the checkmark next to "add to PATH" checked.

Afterwards, on Windows, go to start and type "cmd" to open the command prompt.

Copy the path to the (EscapeRoomGarage) folder where the python files are and paste this like so in the command prompt:

"cd C:\Users\EXAMPLEUSER\Downloads\EscapeRoomGarage\EscapeRoomVenv"

When you have the workspace in your command prompt as your working directory, run this command:

"py -m pip install playsound pygame pynput"

to install the packages that are needed to run main.py, namely playsound, pygame and pynput.

You're finished with installing all the required software. You can now run main.py by double-clicking it.

Have fun!
