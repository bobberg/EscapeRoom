Welcome to the Escape Room

Install python 3.7.3 (tested) from
"https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/"

Afterwards, on Windows, go to start and type "cmd" to open the command prompt.

Copy the path to the (EscapeRoomGarage) folder where the python files are and paste this like so in the command prompt:

"cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\EscapeRoomGarage"

When you have the workspace in your command prompt as your working directory, copy one of these two options into the command prompt:

OPTION 1 Run this command:

"py -m pip install playsound pygame"

to install the packages that are needed to run main.py, namely playsound and pygame

OPTION 2

Alternatively install the requirements.txt using the following command:

"py -m pip install requirements.txt"

You're finished with installing all the required software. You can now run main.py by double-clicking it.

Have fun!
